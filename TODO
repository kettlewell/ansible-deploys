So at this point I have fixed the VPC issue so that I can provision an ec2 instance ( old accounts don't have a default VPC, and need the internet gateway added )

The following are on my current RADAR:

1) create issues instead of a TODO list
2) identify a secure way to shuffle sensitive AWS items ( security groups, keys, subnet ids, etc) so that they don't reside inside of Ansible ( Ansible vault should work )
3) Create clean provisioning role 
4) Create reusable scripts/playbooks to provision masters & slaves from the provision role.
5) Create configure Ansible master role
6) Create configure Spark master role
7) Create configure Spark slave role
8) remove Spark slaves 
9) Autoscaling of spark slaves would rock
10) Create security groups for spark masters, spark slaves
11) create subnets for spark masters and spark slaves
12) create IAM profile/user for spark master, spark slave and ansible master
